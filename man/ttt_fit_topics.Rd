}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A temporally-structued \pkg{quanteda} corpus with a `docar` of
`year`}

\item{years}{If specified, restrict topic models to specified years only}

\item{ntopics}{Number of topics to be fitted. This should be reasonably
large, to allow words not strongly associated with any primary topics to be
allocated to latter, effectively meaningless topics.}

\item{topic}{If specified, construct topic models around the specified
phrase.}

\item{filename}{If specified, the topic model is saved to the nominated file
and can be re-loaded with `x <- readRDS(filename)`.}
